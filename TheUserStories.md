1.As a wife, I want to find where my husband is being held after being picked up by ICE at work so that I can send him a lawyer.

2.As a friend, I want to find where my gay/trans friend has been sent so that I know if they are in a trans/gay friendly facility.

3.As a lawyer, I want to see how long my client has been detained so that I can argue their case.

4.As an advocacy organization for immigrants, I want to get the data of immigrants in detention centers across the country so that we can prove the large number of deportations taking place. 

5.As a volunteer for CIVIC, I want to know where they have transferred my visitee, so that I can keep in contact with them.  

6.An an undocumented person, I'm afraid to write a missing person report, so that I can find someone I know. 

I don't have a computer/internet at home so that I can search for my family member in detention centers.
